Neural Networks are very important in machine learning and growing in popularity due to the major breakthroughs in prior unsolved problems.

The code contain a multilayer neural network in TensorFlow, implementing a XOR gate. The neural network has only one hidden layer and used Gradient Descent to train the neural network.
